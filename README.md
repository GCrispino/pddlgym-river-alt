# pddlgym-river-alt
PDDLGym (alternate) river environment

### Description
This is a [PDDLGym](https://github.com/tomsilver/pddlgym/) version of the River domain described as in [Freire and Delgado (2017)](http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2017/pdfs/p741.pdf).
Note this is not the same as the River domain that comes with PDDLGym (that can be found [here](https://github.com/tomsilver/pddlgym/blob/master/pddlgym/pddl/river.pddl)).
